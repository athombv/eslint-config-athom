name: NPM

# About this workflow:
# It is triggered on push events to branches production and testing. Then it performs a checkout of the current repo
# and sets up a node environment (v12). Following, it will run `npm ci` to build the package. Finally, the `npm
# publish` command will be run, when on branch testing it will run `npm publish --tag beta` to publish it under the
# beta flag on npm. Note: if the package version is not bumped manually the publish step will fail because we can not
# publish to an existing version (see the npm_version_bump_and_publish.yml workflow to solve this).

# Required secrets:
# - NPM_AUTH_TOKEN: required for publishing to npm
# - SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL: required for posting a message in #software

# Optional secrets:
# - SSH_KEY: if `npm ci` needs to install private npm packages

# Note: make sure to commit package-lock.json, this is needed for `npm ci`.

# Note: add `.github` to .npmignore

# Note: when publishing a scoped npm package (e.g. @athombv/node-my-package) append `--access public` to the `npm publish` command, by default scoped packages are published privately.
